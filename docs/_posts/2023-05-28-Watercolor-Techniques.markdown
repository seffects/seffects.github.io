Watercolor is enchanting way to capture the beauty of the flowers. To make a better prompt so that we can get the most beautiful images, we better know the term and techniques. Here are famous water color techniques.

1. Wet-on-Wet Technique:
The wet-on-wet technique involves applying paint to a wet paper surface. This technique allows colors to blend and flow freely, creating soft edges and seamless transitions. To achieve this effect, wet the paper with a brush or spray bottle and then apply the watercolor pigment. The wet surface encourages the colors to interact and diffuse, resulting in a beautifully blended and atmospheric look.

2. Glazing Technique:
Glazing involves layering transparent washes of color on top of each other to create depth and luminosity. Start by applying a light wash of color and let it dry completely. Then, layer subsequent washes, gradually building up the intensity and complexity of the hues. This technique allows for the creation of rich and translucent effects, making it ideal for capturing the subtleties of light and shadow.

3. Dry Brush Technique:
The dry brush technique involves using a relatively dry brush with minimal water or paint. This technique is useful for adding texture and detail to your watercolor painting. Load your brush with a small amount of paint and then lightly drag it across the dry paper surface. The brush bristles create broken and uneven strokes, resulting in a textured appearance. Dry brushing is particularly effective for capturing the intricate details of foliage, textures, and fine lines.

4. Salt Technique:
The salt technique adds a unique texture and pattern to watercolor paintings. After applying a wet wash of color, sprinkle table salt or sea salt onto the damp surface. As the paint dries, the salt absorbs the pigment and creates interesting speckles and granulations. Experiment with different salt grain sizes and application techniques to achieve a variety of captivating effects.

5. Lifting Technique:
The lifting technique involves removing wet or dry watercolor pigment from the paper surface to create highlights or correct mistakes. Use a clean, damp brush or sponge to gently lift or blot the paint. This technique allows for the creation of light areas and the correction of overly saturated or misplaced colors. It requires careful control and precision to achieve the desired effect.
