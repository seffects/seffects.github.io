Paper Art is always fascinating to me. Midjourney can create paper cuts or paper art images. Here’s what I tested for Cat.

In terms of faces or details, paper craft or paper artwork is better. In paper cuts, some of the faces or details are blurred and cannot be recognized correctly. Also, I am not sure how Midjourney interprets ‘happy’ as an animal’s emotion.

/imagine prompt: paper craft kitten, detailed, high resolution, happy


/imagine prompt: paper art, kitten, detailed, high resolution,happy


/imagine prompt: paper cut, kitten, detailed, high resolution, happy


/imagine prompt: cute, kitten, detailed, paper cut


This cat’s face is a bit simplified.

Next time, let’s test how to be more detail in face and emotions.

Enjoy!
